<h1 align="center"> Personal Workout Database Builder</h1>

Personally, I don't exercise often nor do I have a great knowledge of workouts or technique but I have been starting to try and improve my physical health by learning and doing more of both. I thought it would be helpful in order to track exercises I learn about so I could incorporate them in training and also use them as a tool to track my progress. Documenting them this way has been fun and super helpful when I want to plan a work out, I hope you can also use this as a motivational tool to improve physical health.
