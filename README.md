<h1 align="center"> Personal Workout Database Builder</h1>

Personally, I don't exercise often nor do I have a great knowledge of workouts or technique but I have been starting to try and improve my physical health by learning and doing more of both. I thought it would be helpful in order to track exercises I learn about so I could incorporate them in training and also use them as a tool to track my progress. Documenting them this way has been fun and super helpful when I want to plan a work out, I hope you can also use this as a motivational tool to improve physical health.

<h2 align="center"> Usage</h2>

1. Fork the github repo

2. I used yarn to build this, but you can choose to start this with either $ npm start or $ yarn start

3. Install JSON server globally if you havn't done so already by going into terminal and running:

   $ npm install -g json-server
 
4. We would have to run the json server on a different port since we would be using the default 3000 server with our react app, you can change ports using
 
   $ json-server -p 4000 db.json

4. Once the app and json server are running, you feel free to add a workout. 


<h2 align="center"> Roadmap</h2>


Hoping to add more features like a favorites list and a the ability to edit workouts.
